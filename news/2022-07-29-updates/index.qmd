We had another great REU student join us this summer, [Annika Cleven](/people/annika-cleven/). Together with Zane, she continued work on a project that [Jacqueline](/people/jacqueline-dworaczyk/) started in the prior year. The paper should be done soon.

We also published a few more papers this year, links with locations where you can find the papers are in the [publications](/publications.qmd) section of the website. 

And again, this time for year number 14, Dr. Handel, together with his colleague [Paul Thomas](https://www.stjude.org/directory/t/paul-thomas.html), taught within-host modeling and immunology at [SISMID 2022](https://andreashandel.github.io/SISMID2022/). This was another online year, and  all materials used in and produced for this workshop can be found on our [Simulation Modeling and Immunology website](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/).
