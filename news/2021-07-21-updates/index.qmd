Rachel Mercaldo successfully graduated in spring of 2021 and is now working as a Postdoc at the NIH!

We had two great REU students join us this summer, Jacqueline Dworaczyk and Salil Goyal. They made a lot of progress on each of their projects during the summer. Expect to see papers published on those topics soon üòÉ.

We published a few more papers, they can all be found in the [publications](/publications.qmd) section of the website. (Well, not anymore, but you can find a link there to locations where you can find them üòÅ).

Together with his colleague [Paul Thomas](https://www.stjude.org/directory/t/paul-thomas.html), Dr. Handel taught another year of within-host modeling and immunology at [SISMID 2021](https://andreashandel.github.io/SISMID2021/). This was the 13th year of teaching this workshop. Materials used in this workshop can be found on our [Simulation Modeling and Immunology website](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/).

I've made updates to the website, mostly simplifying things. Let me know if anything does not work.
