I am Professor and Associate Department Head in the [Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/epibio/), [College of Public Health](http://www.publichealth.uga.edu/), at the [University of Georgia (UGA)](http://www.uga.edu/).

My research focuses on data analysis and modeling to study the spread and control of infectious diseases, mainly influenza, tuberculosis and norovirus. More recently I also worked on several SARS-CoV-2 projects. You can learn more about this research and our research group on this web site.
