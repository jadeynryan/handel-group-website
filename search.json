    "text": "This page provides brief descriptions and links to various tools we produced or use for our research and teaching.\n\nResearch Resources\nIn recent years, we made sure that for our publications, all code is supplied as supplementary material. In the past, this was not always possible. To allow as much access and reproducibility to our work as possible, we link here to a collection of programs, scripts and descriptions to produce results in various publications.\nYou can get the publications from the publication section of this webpage. Some of the code is relatively well documented, some isn’t. Feel free to use and modify the programs any way you want. If you need help understanding certain programs, I will try to help. But my time is limited, and for a lot of the old programs, I might not even remember anymore what exactly I did. That’s especially true for anything Matlab or Fortran since I haven’t used either in years.\nTB Cough duration analysis - A zip file containing various supplementary R scripts and codebooks for a superspreading/supercoughing study in TB patients. The manuscript describing this work is Handel et al 2019 IJTLD.\nTB-MAC UGA Model - A file containing the R code and description of the model that was used by us to produce the results described in a multi-model project on TB intervention analysis. The results are described in Houben et al. (2016) Lancet Global Health.\nTB Persistence - A collection of R scripts to run the simulations described in our 2014 PLoS One publication Modeling the potential impact of host population survival on the evolution of M. tuberculosis latency.\nAvian flu - a collection of R scripts and accompanying data to do the various analyses described in Handel et al. (2013) PLoS Comp Bio.\nresimmcode.m - A short Matlab program that simulates the dynamics of bacteria and drugs during emergence of resistance. A version of this code was used in Handel et al. (2009) JTB.\nGapjunction ABM - An agent-based simulation, written for the freely available Netlogo platform. The code simulates gap junction mediated antigen transport during the local spread of virus and clearance by CTL. The simulation is described and used in Handel et al. 2009 JRSI.\nBacteria evolution simulation - A Matlab program that simulates the evolution of a bacterial population in repeated exponential growth and serial dilution cycles. A version of this code was used in Handel and Rozen 2009 BMC Evo Bio. Note that this uses the lightspeed collection of Matlab functions.\nCompensatory Mutations - (sparsely documented) Matlab and Fortran programs to simulate the evolution and spread of drug resistance through compensatory mutations. Details about the mathematical model can be found in Handel et al (2006) PLoS Comp Bio.\n\n\nTeaching Resources\nI use the materials in this section for several of the classes and workshops I teach. You are of course free to use them independently from any of my courses.\n\nSoftware\nDSAIDE - Dynamical Systems Approaches to Infectious Disease Epidemiology. This is an R package containing multiple Infectious Disease Epidemiology models that the user/student can run through a graphical user interface.\nDSAIRM - Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling. This R package consists of a set of simulations (refered to here as apps) that teach within-host infection dynamics and immune response modeling from a dynamical system perspective. By manipulating the models through a graphical (Shiny) user interface and working through the provided instructions, you can learn about some important concepts of within-host and immmune response modeling.\nmodelbuilder - Our latest R package, still in development, that allows users to build their own compartmental simulation models and analyze them without having to write any code.\nflowdiagramr - Is an - under development - R package that allows users to use R code to make hopefully nice flow diagrams.\nquizgrader - Is an R package that can be used to deploy a grading app to a Shiny server and auto-grade student quizzes. I use it in my teaching since I don’t like our university’s LMS.\n\n\nOnline Course Materials\nModern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) is a course I regularly teach online. All course materials are available online and can be used by anyone for self-learning.\nSimulation Modeling in Immunology (SMI) is a website with course materials covering within-host modeling and immunology. It is, among other things, used as part of an an annual workshop that I co-teach with my colleague Paul Thomas.\nInfectious Disease Epidemiology - A model based approach (IDEMA) is a graduate level course I regularly teach online. All materials from this course are avaiable on the website.\n\n\nOnline Books and other materials\nInfectious Disease Epidemiology - A model based approach (IDEMA) - an online textbook this book goes with the course of the same mentioned in the previous section. The book will likely be under perpetual development, with some chapters being more complete than others. Most chapters are fairly readable and complete enough that I use it when I teach a course on that topic. It is however not thoroughly fact-checked, error-corrected, properly referenced, etc. While I have been considering the idea of turning this into a full/real book, in my current thinking the cost-benefit analysis doesn’t pan out. I thus plan to leave it online for free as is, with occasional updates and fixes, but without an attempt to make it polished and complete enough for a printed book.\nLists with further resources, pertaining to learning R, Data Analysis, and other topics. - I maintain a compilation of links and bits of information related to my research and teaching on Github. Mainly as a quick look-up and reminder for myself, though others might find it useful too.\n\n\n\nGroup Tools\nThis section is mainly intended for potential group members so they know what they might be getting themselves into. If others profit from some of the information, even better.\nOur current programming environment of choice is the free and Open Source software R. We use it for almost all of our projects. While not required, using R through R Studio makes working in R more user/beginner friendly. R Studio is also free. Almost all of our current writing is also done in the R ecosystem using Rmarkdown/bookdown/blogdown, etc.\nIn the past, we have used Netlogo, a free agent based simulation platform, for both teaching and research. It is fairly easy to program, has lots of examples and is quite flexible. The main disadvantage is that it’s not that fast.\nSometimes we need to do a bit of analytics. While Mathematica and Maple are the two main programs for analytical calculations, they are expensive. We have found that for our purpose, the freely available Maxima suffices.\nWe do all our reference management using the BibTeX format with either JabRef or Zotero as front end reference manager. Both are free.\nIf you need to regularly synchronzie files between different machines, Dropbox, is very useful. Dropbox even works nicely with large files, such as encrypted VeraCrypt containers. For more structured work and syncing between computers and users, Github is our preferred mode of work.\nIf you can get people to send you their data, great! But often, that fails, even if the data is already published. A great tool to extract data from figures is the free program Engauge Digitizer. The program Data Thief provides similar functionality."

    "text": "General Information\nWe use mathematical, statistical and computational methods to analyze and model infectious diseases. We do not perform any lab experiments or do field work to collect data. Instead, we closely collaborate with experimentalists and field epidemiologists.\nAny of our projects need analytical and computational skills. Most projects require some level of computer programming, mostly done in the R language. For any project, a willingness to learn both the analytical/computational tools and the details of the biological system are crucial.\nAs an example, check out this paper from our group and the supplementary material, which contains all analysis code. If you explore the supplementary material and look at the code, you should get a good idea of the kind of projects we work on in our group.\n\n\nPostdocs\nI might have funding available, though I don’t have an official position posted. But I am always interested to hear from qualified candidates. Reach out, and if I think you might be a good fit, I’ll get back to you and we can talk. Also reach out if you are interested in joining the group and you have your own funding, or you want to develop a proposal for funding based on possible work in our group. Finally, I am open to joint Postdoc arrangements between my group and others, for instance colleagues from CEID or anywhere else at UGA and beyond.\n\n\nGraduate Students\nIf you are a current UGA student and interested in our research, contact me and we can discuss if there are ways you can get involved. Also check out opportunities for external funding described below. And if you want to write a proposal with me as mentor, please contact me and we can discuss possible projects. If you are not currently a UGA student, you would need to apply to and be admitted by our program in order to join our research group.\n\n\nUndergraduate Students\nI sometimes have projects that might be suitable for undergraduate students. You will either need to know or be willing to learn programming in R and some statistics or differential equation modeling. If you are interested in doing some infectious disease research, take a look at some of our recent projects (e.g., the one linked to above) and if you like what you see, contact me.\n\n\nExternal Funding Opportunities\nSometimes I have funding for students and postdocs, sometimes I don’t. In either case, it is very useful for you to apply for your own funding. Getting a grant or fellowship looks very good on your CV. It also gives you more flexibility and security. Below is a list of external funding sources for students and postdocs. Entries are listed in no particular order. This list is by no means complete, and I’m not updating it too often. If you know of any good sources I omitted, or if you find outdated information, please let me know.\nI try to keep the links below updated, if you find any information is not current anymore, please let me know.\n\nGeneral Funding Resources\nThese funding opportunities apply to individuals at different stages of their careers (students/postdocs).\nNIH Training Awards (F31, F32, etc.) (most are US citizens/residents only)\nORISE - Funding to perform research at the CDC\nAssociation of Schools of Public Health - various funding opportunities\nFord Foundation Fellowships\nBig list of links hosted by UC Berkeley\nU Penn fellowship list - a list focusing on fellowships that don’t require U.S. citizenship.\nProFellow - a website that has a database with various funding resources.\n\n\nUndergraduate Funding\nUGA’s Center for Undergraduate Research Opportunities\n\n\nGraduate Funding\nA great list/spreadsheet of funding opportunities for graduate students\nAnother comprehensive list of different fellowships available for graduate students\nA list for different types of federal STEM funding opportunities\nGraduate Women in Science Fellowships Program (relatively small awards)\nNSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants\nHertz Foundation\nDepartment of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (US citizens/residents)\n\n\nPostdoctoral Funding\nNSF Information for Postdoctoral Fellows\nHelen Hay Whitney Foundation Research Fellowships\nNIH Career Development Awards\nLife Sciences Research Foundation\nNSF Information for Postdoctoral Fellows\nA long list of opportunities listed hosted by UC Berkeley"

We use mathematical models, computational simulations and statistical analysis to understand the dynamics of pathogens on different spatial and temporal scales.\nOne part of our research deals with the spread of disease inside an infected individual. These within-host studies involve modeling pathogen and immune response, and sometimes drugs, to understand what determines disease severity and infectiousness.\nThe other part of our research concerns the spread and control of disease on the population level. These between-host studies focus on the dynamics, control and evolution of pathogens.\nThe ultimate goal of our work is to help design better intervention and control strategies against infectious diseases, both for individual patients and on the population level.\nMore information about our research can be found in the current project descriptions and publications from completed projects."

The work is part of the Center for Influenza Vaccine Research for High-Risk Populations (CIVR-HRP), which is a component of NIH’s Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs) program.\n\n\nModel-guided vaccines for norovirus\n\nWe are working on better understanding aspects of norovirus within-host and epidemiological dynamics and potential control. We analyze and model data that can inform the development and deployment of future norovirus vaccines. This is part of an NIH funded project with collaborators Ben Lopman, Katia Koelle and Juan Leon at Emory, as well as colleagues from other universities, the CDC and Takeda.\n\n\nModeling and analysis of influenza immune responses\n\nWe want to understand what mechanisms lead to good induction of memory immune responses following vaccination, and what mechanisms influence the severity of infections. To that end, we combine statistical and mechanistic models with data. We work on several projects in this area, some are part of the the Center for Influenza Vaccine Research for High-Risk Populations (CIVR-HRP), others are part of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research (CIDER), a component of NIH’s Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response (CEIRR), and some are part of the project Dynamics and Evolution of Immune Responses to Influenza Viruses with colleague Rustom Antia as PI and other collaborators."

Now, instead of trying to manage publications on this website, I’m just pointing to my (fairly well maintained) publication entries at NCBI/NIH My Bibliography or Google Scholar.\nOf course, those only show papers where I (Andreas) am a co-author. There are some papers that members of our group co-authored on which I am not listed. To find those, go to that group member’s website. Also note that neither listing is great. For some reason, NCBI adds papers that come from co-authors funded by the same grants, even if we are not involved. And Google sometimes indexes pre-prints and posters. Either way, you should be able to figure out what we are up to.\nI believe that tax-payer funded research findings should be publicly available and not behind a pay-wall. One nice feature about listing all papers here was that I could provide pdfs to all of them. With the new setup, this doesn’t work anymore. You should be able to get pdfs of either the final paper or the draft through the NCBI/NIH My Bibliography link.

    "text": "We had another great REU student join us this summer, Annika Cleven. Together with Zane, she continued work on a project that Jacqueline started in the prior year. The paper should be done soon.\nWe also published a few more papers this year, links with locations where you can find the papers are in the publications section of the website.\nAnd again, this time for year number 14, Dr. Handel, together with his colleague Paul Thomas, taught within-host modeling and immunology at SISMID 2022. This was another online year, and all materials used in and produced for this workshop can be found on our Simulation Modeling and Immunology website."
