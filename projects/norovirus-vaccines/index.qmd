We are working on better understanding aspects of norovirus within-host and epidemiological dynamics and potential control. We analyze and model data that can inform the development and deployment of future norovirus vaccines. This is part of an NIH funded project with collaborators [Ben Lopman](https://www.blopman.net/), [Katia Koelle](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/) and [Juan Leon](https://www.sph.emory.edu/research/centers/leonlab/index.html) at Emory, as well as colleagues from other universities, the CDC and Takeda.
