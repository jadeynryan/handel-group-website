We are using modeling and analysis approaches to determine how to optimize vaccine formulation, with a focus on the impact of dose for future universal influenza vaccines. The work is part of the [Center for Influenza Vaccine Research for High-Risk Populations (CIVR-HRP)](https://www.niaidcivics.org/center-for-influenza-vaccine-research-for-high-risk-populations-civr-hrp/), which is a component of NIHâ€™s [Collaborative Influenza Vaccine Innovation Centers (CIVICs) program](https://www.niaidcivics.org/).
